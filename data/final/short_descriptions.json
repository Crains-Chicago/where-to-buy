It was the original location of the South Side Irish Parade before it was relocated to the Beverly neighborhood farther southwest in the city.<br /><br />Auburn Gresham's development as a community dates back to the early nineteenth century, when the area was defined primarily by small German and Dutch settlements. A later influx of Irish railroad workers and others lured to the South Side by newly extended city services in the late nineteenth century led to further residential and commercial growth. In the 1920s, the population increased nearly threefold, from 19,558 to 57,381. The plethora of bungalow-style housing and brick two-flat apartment buildings throughout Auburn Gresham serves as lasting evidence of the community's formative years.<br /><br />Auburn Gresham is serviced by a Metra commuter rail stop at W. 87th St. and Vincennes Ave., which provides daily inbound service to LaSalle Street Station in Chicago and outbound service to Joliet. Community leaders have long encouraged the construction of an additional Metra rail stop at W. 79th St. In 2014, the City of Chicago obtained a half-acre parcel of land on which to construct the station. CTA red line stops at 79th St. and 87th St. are also available along the Dan Ryan Expressway in nearby Chatham.<br /><br />Chicago Public Library operates the Thurgood Marshall Branch in Auburn Gresham at W. 75th St. and S.

A segment of the eastern part of the Ridge Country Club lies with the boundaries of the community. Sparsely settled in the middle of the 19th century, Beverly began to be developed by business interests from Chicago in the latter part of the nineteenth century, encouraged largely by the completion in 1889 of the suburban line of the Rock Island Railroad that runs parallel with the eastern edge of the Blue Island ridge (see the Ulrich & Son ad that appears elsewhere in this article). The natural beauty of its position on the ridge allowed the community to become an exclusive streetcar suburb, and the homes and large lots reflect this historic distinction. Beverly is located on the highest elevation in Chicago, and is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhoods in the city.", "WASHINGTON HEIGHTS": "Washington Heights, one of the 77 official community areas, is located on the far south side of the city of Chicago, Illinois, loosely bordered in the south by 107th street, the north by 89th street, the west by Beverly Avenue and the East by Eggleston Avenue.<br /><br />Illinois Place Names (Illinois State Historical Society Occasional Publications Number 55, 1989) indicates that the area of Washington Heights historically was also known as Blue Island Ridge, Campbell's Woods, Dummy Junction, and North Blue Island. A Post Office by the name of Washington Heights was established 25 October 1869 and dissolved 6 June 1894. As noted, it is now part of Chicago. It was one of the many small towns and villages that were annexed into the City of Chicago in the late 19th century. At this time, it was predominantly a bedroom community of German and Irish families whose immigration to the Midwestern United States began circa 1880.<br /><br />The landscape of Washington Heights changed beginning in the late 1960s as a result of two factors. The West Leg extension of the Dan Ryan Expressway, more commonly known as Interstate 57, cut through the southern half of the community, dividing the area and displacing several long-time residents. It opened in October 1967. Simultaneously, a growing number of African Americans began moving into the community. Adjacent Auburn Gresham and Roseland also began experiencing white flight during the 1960s in the same way that communities to the north, such as Englewood and Greater Grand Crossing, experienced the decade prior. In the 1970s the demographics of Washington Heights changed primarily to African-American, as it still exists today. The community continues to retain its middle-class character.<br /><br /><br /><br />Washington Heights is serviced by three Metra commuter rail stops, which provide daily inbound service to LaSalle Street Station in Chicago and outbound service to Joliet. A CTA red line stop at 95th St. is also available along the Dan Ryan Expressway in nearby Roseland.<br /><br />Washington Heights has seen redevelopment in recent years. One of the largest single-family home developments in the city, \"The Renaissance at Beverly Ridge,\" is under construction in the southwest corner of Washington Heights at W 105th Street and S Throop Ave on the former Chicago Bridge & Iron Company site. Likewise, a formerly abandoned railroad line that ran along the southwestern edge of the community was acquired by the Chicago Park District and converted into the \"Major Taylor Trail\" in 2007.

It is a predominantly Irish-Catholic neighborhood on the South Side of the city. It borders the neighborhoods of Beverly and Morgan Park to the east, the suburb of Evergreen Park to the north, the suburb of Oak Lawn to the west, and the suburbs of Merrionette Park and Alsip to the south. Because of the presence of the cemeteries along the eastern edge of the neighborhood, the area was fictitiously said to have been known as \"Seven Holy Tombs\" before it was known as Mount Greenwood by author and playwright, John R. Powers in his fictionalized trilogy about growing up there. Mount Greenwood is about 14 miles (23 km) southwest of the Loop.<br /><br />The origins of Mount Greenwood began in 1879 when the surveyor George Washington Waite (b.1839) platted an eighty-acre land grant that he had received from the federal government. Mount Greenwood Cemetery was established in that year on what had between 1854 and 1869 been the farm of Benjamin Kaylor. The cemetery was developed by businessmen from Blue Island who needed a place to relocate the remains of individuals who had previously been buried in that community's municipal cemetery, which the village board had deemed a public nuisance after its growth had become unmanageable. The cemetery is the final resting-place of Robert Haslam (1840-1912), who as a twenty-year-old immigrant from England became one of the most celebrated riders of the Pony Express mail service that operated from 1860-1861. Although completely surrounded by the City of Chicago, Mount Greenwood Cemetery is not part of Chicago. It is in unincorporated Cook County, Illinois. Mount Greenwood was incorporated as a village in 1907 and annexed to Chicago on February 22, 1927.<br /><br />Mount Greenwood is home to many Chicago firefighters, police officers and union workers of Irish heritage.", "MORGAN PARK": "Morgan Park, located on the far south side of the city of Chicago, Illinois, United States, is one of the city's 77 semi-official community areas.", "OHARE": "O'Hare, located on the far northwest side of Chicago, Illinois, is one of the city's 77 official community areas.

As one of Chicago's 77 official community areas, Edgewater is bounded by Foster Avenue on the south, Devon Avenue on the north, Ravenswood Avenue on the west, and Lake Michigan on the east. Edgewater contains several beaches that residents enjoy in the late spring, summer, and early autumn. Chicago's largest park, Lincoln Park, stretches south from Edgewater for seven miles along the waterfront, almost to downtown. Historically, Edgewater was the northeastern corner of Lake View Township, an independent suburb which was annexed by the city of Chicago in 1889. Today, the Uptown community is to Edgewater's south, Lincoln Square to its west, West Ridge to its northwest and Rogers Park to its north.<br /><br />Edgewater was first developed around the 1880s as a summer home for Chicago's elite. Today, it provides the northern terminus of both Lincoln Park and Lake Shore Drive. With the exception of pockets acknowledged as historic districts (like the Bryn Mawr Historic District), east-Edgewater (Edgewater Beach) boasts a skyline of high-rise apartment buildings, condominium complexes, and mid-rise homes. To the west, Edgewater is characterized by commercial businesses; single-family homes; and two-, three-, or four-story flats, including the historic neighborhood of Andersonville.", "EDISON PARK": "Edison Park (formerly Canfield) is one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, in North Side, Chicago, Illinois.<br /><br />It consists entirely of the Edison Park neighborhood, and is named after Thomas Alva Edison. T. Edison gave his blessing to this community namesake in 1890. According to the 2000 Census, its population is 11,259. Edison Park has one of the highest concentrations of Irish ancestry in Chicago, where they make up over three-fourths of the neighborhood's population.<br /><br />Located between the Des Plaines River and the Chicago River this area served as a local continental divide, with the Chicago River flowing then into Lake Michigan, which connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the Great Lakes, and the Des Plaines River feeding into the Illinois River and the Mississippi River to reach the Gulf of Mexico. Edison Park served as one of the portage points for early travelers who would carry their canoes across it to the north branch of the Chicago River corridor and is conveniently located next to Portage Park, Chicago, more generally recognized for this type of access.<br /><br />Edison Park's settlement history dates back to 1834, with the arrival of pioneer Christian Ebinger Sr., 21, and his family: parents John and Katherine Ebinger along with his new bride, Barbara. As they traveled northwest from Chicago on the Indian trail to Milwaukee, Wisconsin (Milwaukee Avenue), their single horse was bitten by a snake and died, leaving them stranded. Consequently, the Ebingers decided to settle between Touhy and Devon. Their settlement location was west of the North Branch of the Chicago River, where they were joined by Christian's older brothers Frederick and John along with their sister Elizabeth (Mrs. John) Plank. The local public elementary school was named after Christian Ebinger. Edison Park incorporated as a village in 1881 and was annexed to Chicago on November 8, 1910.<br /><br />One tradition in the community since 1972 is the Edison Park Festival, an end-of-summer weekend sponsored by the Edison Park Chamber of Commerce, combining merchant sidewalk sales, entertainment, a parade, Taste of Chicago and arts and crafts. It is an opportunity to introduce visitors to the benefits and beauty of the Edison Park community. The EP Fest is celebrated every year in mid-August.<br /><br /><br /><br />Edison Park has the lowest violent crime rate of any Chicago neighborhood. Ranked as one of the best neighborhoods in Chicago, Edison Park also boasts a variety of restaurants and bars."}
